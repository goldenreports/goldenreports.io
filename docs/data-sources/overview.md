# Overview

## Introduction

Data sources are an abstraction that represents a connection to a source
of information. We currently support the following sources:

* PostgreSQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Mongo DB
* REST Service
* GraphQL

If the data source you use is not in the list, you can extend the data
source framework following our tutorials.
