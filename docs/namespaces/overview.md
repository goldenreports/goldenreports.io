# Overview

## Introduction

Namespaces play a similar role than a folder or directory in your file system.

Their main purpose is to group a set of related objects together.

Those objects could be:
* Child namespaces
* Data sources
* Data contexts
* Reports

For the sake of usability it's recommended to keep the namespace hierarchy as small as possible but, at the end, is completely up to you and your specific requirements.
